POS malaysia interview question

# Personal Note

Tbh, I didn't expect the same question to be tested. I did not try this question at all as I wanted to have a true test of what I am able to grasp again. Oh well, too bad. On to the next interview!

# Future enhancement

Made silly mistakes along the way as I was out of touch on Javascript and it's relevant framework for 6 months. There's still room for optimization in respect to UI/UX experience and application performance

1. Lazy loading for posts components in routing
2. Handle loading and error states for API request
3. Could possibly use route guard to fetch and load data first before permitting user to visit the page depending on desired behaviour. (In this case, don't think it's necessary)
